This Scala code is an implementation of a Kafka producer-consumer using the Akka framework. It's designed to read messages from one Kafka topic and write them to another, using transactional semantics to ensure that messages are processed exactly once.

The code starts by setting up an `ActorSystem` and an [`ExecutionContext`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fash%2F.cache%2Fcoursier%2Fv1%2Fhttps%2Frepo1.maven.org%2Fmaven2%2Forg%2Fscala-lang%2Fscala-library%2F2.13.12%2Fscala-library-2.13.12-sources.jar!%2Fscala%2Fconcurrent%2FExecutionContext.scala%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fash%2F.cache%2Fcoursier%2Fv1%2Fhttps%2Frepo1.maven.org%2Fmaven2%2Forg%2Fscala-lang%2Fscala-library%2F2.13.12%2Fscala-library-2.13.12-sources.jar!%2Fscala%2Fconcurrent%2FExecutionContext.scala%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22jar%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A121%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%5D "file:///home/ash/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.12/scala-library-2.13.12-sources.jar!/scala/concurrent/ExecutionContext.scala"). The `ActorSystem` is a key component of Akka, providing the runtime environment for actors. The [`ExecutionContext`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fash%2F.cache%2Fcoursier%2Fv1%2Fhttps%2Frepo1.maven.org%2Fmaven2%2Forg%2Fscala-lang%2Fscala-library%2F2.13.12%2Fscala-library-2.13.12-sources.jar!%2Fscala%2Fconcurrent%2FExecutionContext.scala%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Fash%2F.cache%2Fcoursier%2Fv1%2Fhttps%2Frepo1.maven.org%2Fmaven2%2Forg%2Fscala-lang%2Fscala-library%2F2.13.12%2Fscala-library-2.13.12-sources.jar!%2Fscala%2Fconcurrent%2FExecutionContext.scala%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22jar%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A121%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%5D "file:///home/ash/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.13.12/scala-library-2.13.12-sources.jar!/scala/concurrent/ExecutionContext.scala") is used for executing futures, which are a way of handling asynchronous operations in Scala.

The [`main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fash%2FDocuments%2Fml-resources%2Fakka-kafka%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fscala%2FProducerConsumer.scala%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A27%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "src/main/scala/ProducerConsumer.scala") function begins by checking that exactly one command-line argument has been provided. This argument is used as the transaction ID for the Kafka producer.

Next, the code sets up the configuration for the Kafka consumer and producer. The consumer and producer settings are created from the system configuration, with the Kafka bootstrap servers, group ID, and other properties being set explicitly. The serializers and deserializers used are for strings, meaning that this code is designed to work with Kafka messages where both the keys and the values are strings.

The `Transactional.source` method is used to create a source of messages from the Kafka topic "test1". Each message is then transformed into a `ProducerMessage` for the "test2" topic, with the key being the original key and the value being the original value. The `Transactional.sink` method is used to send these messages to Kafka, with the transaction ID being used to ensure exactly-once semantics.

Finally, the code waits for the user to press Enter, at which point it drains the source (i.e., processes all remaining messages) and then shuts down the actor system. The `drainAndShutdown` method returns a `Future`, and the `onComplete` method is used to ensure that the actor system is terminated when this future completes.

# Produce to a topic

Have docker compose and kafkacat installed.

Start the docker instances by running the following from the root of the project. 
    
    docker compose up

By default creates topic named `test`, `test2`, and so on until `test6`. 

Then to produce to the topic test you can use kafkcat like this:
    
    kafkacat -P -b 127.0.0.1:9092 -t test

This starts kafkacat in producer mode. To send a record, enter some text and press ENTER.


To make sure this works entering the follwing in another terminal tab should give you the produced messages.

    kafkacat -C -b 0.0.0.0:9092 -t test
